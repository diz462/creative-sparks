# creative-sparks

I originally started this repository to learn and practice Git/GitHub. I also wanted to track my development progress while starting this journey into image processing and computer vision. There are so many things to learn that it's hard to know where to start if you don't have a computer science background or someone to guide you.

I fell into this rabbit hole after taking an image processing course during grad school. This field is a limitless well of opportunity for those who may find themselves on the same journey. My aim for this repo is to provide a sandbox for anyone interested in medical image processing, computer vision, and/or deep learning. I hope that you find the same inspiration that I found using the resources below.

## Learning Resources

I will continue to update this list.

### Git & GitHub

* [Git & GitHub Crash Course](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk?si=k4wBV5-vBJKGbdm0) - YouTube video from freeCodeCamp. Also covers *VS Code* which is very useful for writing different types of code without having to switch between IDEs. GitHub Copilot integration extremely helpful.

* [Atlassian Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git) - Git commands wiki style reference.

* [Git Interactive](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;) - Git interactive cheat sheet.

### Best Practices

* [Coding & Comment Style](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/coding-and-comment-style/) - Helpful guidelines to improve your code.

* [Coding Style & Structure Examples](https://github.com/mitcommlab/Coding-Documentation/tree/master) - Examples for writing better code and stucturing files.

### Programming Languages

* [Python Tutorial](https://youtu.be/t8pPdKYpowI?si=7jN4-_nY_vNRMvTV) - YouTube video by Nana. Also covers *PyCharm*. I prefer PyCharm if I'm mainly coding in Python.

* [Markdown Crash Course](https://youtu.be/_PPWWRV6gbA?si=BYYi4Sep-faI4HmK) - YouTube video by Web Dev Simplified.

* [Markdown in VS Code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-markdown-in-vscode/) - Tutorial by freeCodeCamp.

### Computer Science

* [Intro to Discrete Math for CS](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) - Coursera course from UC San Diego, recommended before taking Data Structures & Algorithms.

* [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) - Coursera course from UC San Diego.

### Computer Vision

* [First Principles of Computer Vision](https://fpcv.cs.columbia.edu/) - Lectures by Shree Nayar from Columbia University. It's better than any of the courses I've taken in grad school.

* [Computer Vision](https://udlbook.github.io/cvbook/) - Free ebook by Simon Prince, covering fundamental concepts.

### Deep Learning

* [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) - Free ebook by Simon Prince.
